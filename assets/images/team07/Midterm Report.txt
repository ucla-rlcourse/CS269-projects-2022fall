In an environment, the policy will make an action each day to either buy or sell stock or do nothing. 
We began an experiment starting with a random policy that gives random action to a given observation. 
To first test on a random policy, we first created an environment containing single stock environment from one company. 
This policy randomly buys and sells stocks regardless of the observation, assuming its account balance does not turn negative. 
Testing this policy on Appleâ€™s stock data, this policy showed high robustness against the stock market crash but heavily relied on the environment. 
However, the random policy produces positive relationship between robustness and the processing time. Next, we also created a naive policy.
The policy holds to buy stocks until it observes two consecutive days where the stock price increases. 
It also sells stocks when it observes one day of price decrease yet the resulting price is still higher than the price when it bought them. 
In the last day before the set time period ends, it sells all the stocks owned. 
This policy generally earns more than the random policy, but the results are less robust.
