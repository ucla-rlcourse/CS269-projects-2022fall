## Main Content
Your article starts here. You can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/lilianweng/lil-log/tree/master/_posts) of [lil's blogs](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) for article structure ideas or Markdown syntax. We've provided a [sample post](https://ucla-rlcourse.github.io/CS269-projects-2022fall/2017/06/21/an-overview-of-deep-learning.html) from Lilian Weng and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/ucla-rlcourse/CS269-projects-2022fall/blob/main/_posts/2017-06-21-an-overview-of-deep-learning.md)

## Basic Syntax
### Image
Please create a folder with the name of your team id under `/assets/images/`, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.

You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/team00/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}
*Fig 1. YOLO: An object detection method in computer vision* [1].

Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work.


### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |



### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.

### More Markdown Syntax
You can find more Markdown syntax at [this page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Data Rich and Physics Certain

| Experiment 					| Parameters  											| Results  								| Comments 							|
| :---       					|    :----:   											|     :---: 							|     ---: 							|
| **DL + Data**																																						|

| Predicting only velocity  	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->5->5->1 <br> activation: ReLU	|  ~100% accurate	| Generalises well over various initial velocities |
| Predicting only displacement 	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable		| Better prediction for $u_0 \in dataset$, average prediction outside | 
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->2 <br>	activation: tanh	|	Reasonable		| Better prediction for $u_0 \in dataset$, poor prediction outside |

-----

| **DL + Physics**																																			|
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{physics} = \|v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted}\|$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	~0% accuracy		| Expected result as no supervision of any kind is provided |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{velocity+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Prediction of $v_t$ is good. Was able to learn $s_t$ reasonably well without direct supervision |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{supervised+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+(s_{predicted}-s_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Not a better result w.r.t direct supervision |


**Observations :** 
- Physics equations are certain in this case and are the best to use.
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are equivalent (actual accuracy/loss varies based on fine training, random dataset generation)

Re running the above experiments with Dataset size of 200(Data Starvation), yielded the following observations
- DL performance is comparable with 10000 dataset when trained on much mode epochs(5x)
- Hybrid(DL+Physics) without direct supervision on $s_t$ has comparable/better closeness than DL only method for limited epochs($\sim$300) training.

| **DL + Physics**																																			|
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$<br> using Loss $L_{physics} = \|v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted}\|$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	~0% accuracy		| Expected result as no supervision of any kind is provided |

**Observations :** 
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are similar, Hybrid(DL+Physics) is better when $u0$ is out of dataset, DL is better for $u0$ in dataset.
- Physics equations are not certain in this case and the above methods are better to use than Physics.

## Data Starvation and Physics Uncertain
- Similar observations as in data rich
