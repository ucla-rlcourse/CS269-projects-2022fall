## Abstract
Reinforcement learning is a powerful data-driven control method in autonomous driving tasks. The MetaDrive simulator provides diverse driving scenarios for agents driving on the highway. "How long will agents stay on the highway?" is one of the curious questions that agents care about. Suppose those multi-agents will drive on and off-highway different freeway ramps, the project goal is to find an optimal way that all of the agents could sum up with the least time spent on the highway.

## Objective
Optimize the least sum-up time for all these multi-agents.

## Potential Approach
In this project, we also need to introduce a timer parameter into the action-value function. Despite the safety consideration, we also want to minimize the time spent.

Since it is a multi-agent problem, we should look into each agent first. For each agent, we might use the Q-learning algorithm to learn decision policies determined by the stateaction-value function Q, and Q estimates long-term discounted rewards for each state-action pair. For each action agent takes, we are considering long-term rewards since we can only know if those actions can maximize future rewards (until all the agents are off the highway).

We might proceed Temporal-Difference(TD) Learning to learn the utility of being in the states themselves. The advantage of TD could learn online after each step and learn from incomplete episodes. It is time-consuming if multi-agents take action and enumerates all possible outcomes. TD learning could bring a more efficient estimation of the value for each step.

## Potential Environment
MetaDrive with multi-agents at the highway
