## Introduction
MetaDrive is a driving simulator that is compositional, lightweight and realistic. The team consider this driving senario generator a great test generator for the reinforcemnt learning methods. This quarter, the team want to explore safe reinforcement learning with this great simulator. Safe reiforcement learning, is the method of reinfocement learning policies that maximizes expectation reward while requires certain system performance or under safety constraints. (Garc´ıa, A comprehensive survey on Safe Reinforcement Learning 2015). In this driving simulator environment, the team consider the characteristic of safe rl can be fully measured and implemented. There are several approaches to this problem and the team will explore them.

##Procedure
Metadrive based. (More content yet to be posted. This is a draft of proposal and could be changed:))
