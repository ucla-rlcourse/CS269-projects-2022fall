## Project Proposal

Model-based RL can improve data efficiency and reduce the amount of data needed when switching to a new environment, but for the zero-shot scenario, it doesn't necessarily generalize to a new world different without extra techniques ([2], [3]). Recently, some model-based works take the object-centric approach to learning world models in multi-object settings and achieve much better zero-shot generalization performance since such world models can much more easily adapt to different numbers of objects ([1], [4], [5]). However, the objects in the current object-centric world model are treated implicitly and can't be utilized explicitly for planning. People still have to treat the entire object-centric world model as one black box, just like other kinds of world models during planning.

To achieve better planning in zero-shot generalization tasks, we propose to learn imagined actions over perceived objects in the learned world model. The imagined action is an interface to imagine how the object could be changed regardless of how it's achieved (the agent would change it, and the other objects can also affect it). Then, we can imagine first what 'action' should the goal object take to achieve the goal state, and then imagine what other object should 'act' to provide the goal object's desired action, and iteratively all the way back to the agent's own action space. In this way, especially in the multi-object control task, the exponentially complex planning task is decomposed into sub-problems that each is easy to plan.

We will implement our method based on Rishi's OP3 method ([5]), which learns a general object-centric world model structure. We will create a billiard ball environment to test and improve the algorithm. We also plan to borrow some of Meta World's robotic arm control tasks ([6]) and make some creative tool usage tasks that require robots to use objects as tools without supervision and demonstration.

_Note: we intend this project to be a fully academic project and publish later. We'd appreciate our fellow classmates to keep the content confidential._

## Basic Syntax
### Image
Please create a folder with the name of your team id under `/assets/images/`, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.

You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/team00/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}

Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work.


### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |



### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.

| Predicting only velocity  	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->5->5->1 <br> activation: ReLU	|  ~100% accurate	| Generalises well over various initial velocities |
| Predicting only displacement 	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable		| Better prediction for $u_0 \in dataset$, average prediction outside |

| **DL + Physics**																																			|
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{physics} = \|v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted}\|$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	~0% accuracy		| Expected result as no supervision of any kind is provided |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{velocity+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Prediction of $v_t$ is good. Was able to learn $s_t$ reasonably well without direct supervision |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{supervised+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+(s_{predicted}-s_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Not a better result w.r.t direct supervision |


**Observations :** 
- Physics equations are certain in this case and are the best to use.
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are equivalent (actual accuracy/loss varies based on fine training, random dataset generation)

Re running the above experiments with Dataset size of 200(Data Starvation), yielded the following observations
- DL performance is comparable with 10000 dataset when trained on much mode epochs(5x)
- Hybrid(DL+Physics) without direct supervision on $s_t$ has comparable/better closeness than DL only method for limited epochs($\sim$300) training.

**Observations :** 
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are similar, Hybrid(DL+Physics) is better when $u0$ is out of dataset, DL is better for $u0$ in dataset.
- Physics equations are not certain in this case and the above methods are better to use than Physics.
