## Introduction
Hello everyone. We plan on exploring the use of reinforcement learning for self driving cars in realistic simulated urban environments. We plan on utilizing the autonomous vehicle research platform “CARLA”. CARLA allows researchers to study various autonomous vehicle systems in a highly realistic and customizable computer simulated environment. There are simulated sensors for self-driving vehicles in CARLA that are essentially one-to-one analogues to their real-world counterparts. Furthermore, the behavior of the surrounding simulated environment is highly modifiable, thus allowing us to test our agent in various environments. 

## Plan
This is our initial plan: We plan to train a single self-driving car using various reinforcement learning algorithms to navigate an urban environment through a set route. Initially having our environment and route fixed will allow us to measure the performance of various reinforcement learning algorithms against each other and potentially try strategies not seen in academic papers currently. Once we train our algorithm on a fixed environment, we plan to test its ability to generalize by setting up different (perhaps adversarial) scenarios for the algorithm to navigate. We plan on using only the realistic simulated sensors for our autonomous vehicles as well as a map of the environment. In conclusion, we expect to find the best performing reinforcement learning algorithm for an autonomous car in our realistic simulated environment.
