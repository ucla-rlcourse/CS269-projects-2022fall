<!--
ABSTRACT
1. In tooth prep in dental surgery, it is important to acheive accuracy and speed.
2. However, dentists have done manually but the robot arm has to be commanded manually all trajectories.
3. In this paper, we would like to propose rl-based planner for dental surgery specifically tooth prep for crown
4. To automate this procedure with rl agent in simulator and impose the traj in real world to make to robot arm follow
5. how: RoboDK with robot and tool info + openAI gym for trial and error to find the best traj while avoiding various types of obstaacles in patient jaw. 
6. brief result - expected result: we will simulate and visualize in the simulation that the trajectory has been generated in 
engineer-manually hard coded trajectory 
evaluate time, accuracy and safety(obstacale avoidance etc)
hopefully run in the real robot arm for evaluation as well
Keyword, path planning, obstacle avoidance, dental surgical robotics, reinforcement learning

> With advancement in robotic technologies, in the field of medical surgery, artificial intelligence and machine learning plays a pivital role in medical imaging, prognosis/diagnosis, treatment assistant, and automation of repetitive substasks of surgery. However, specifically in dental surgery, reinforcement learning has not been actively applied while it has a lot in common with robot machining where RL is widely used for fully-automated trajectory generation. Therefore, in this article, by developing RL-based tool trajectory planner, we would like to enable robot arm to automatically perform a few subtasks in dental surgery such as tooth preparation for crown through removal of cavity. We will use CopelliaSim for simulation environment, Python/Pytorch for RL, and MATLAB for robotics. The expected result of this project would be RL-based, collision-free, fully-automated dental tool trajectory generation.

## Introduction
<!--1. Dentistry industry expands, thanks to robotics tech, Status of dental surgery automation + robotics tech
(related work in dental robotics)-->
With advent of aging society and the advancement in robtic technologies, dentistry industry becomes one of the biggest market in the field of robotics. Since various surgeries in dentistry involve high-precision and repetitive tasks, robot technologies have significant potential and ability to assist dentists or perform certain types of tasks over human practioners. Many researches have been conducted applying the robot technologies to dentistry such as maxillofacial surgery [[1-3]](#reference), tooth preparation [[4]](#reference), and robot assistant [[5]](#reference).
<!--2. Also AI, but is limited in the field of diagnosis estimation assesment even though rl agent has been started in the other medical field for control(related work in dental robotics & surgical robots)
3. among many procedure, prep tooth for crown has lots in common with robot machining and many literatures exist
(related work in robot machining)-->
On top of that, along with the robotics technologies, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in dentistry as well. The ML and AI is often faciliated in dental imaging and diagonsis: clinical diagnosis [[6]](#reference), dental radiography [[8]](#reference), and oral cancer prediction [[9]](#reference). However, compared to other fields of surgical robots [[10-14]](#reference), reinforcement learning (RL) has not been actively applied in dentistry. For the most commonly used commercial surgical robot, da Vinchi System, open-source environment is provided for users to apply reinforcement learning algorithms for controlling the surgical arms [[10-11]](#reference). While subtasks of surgery in dentistry such as implantology and tooth preparation for crown has a lot in common with the field of robot machining where RL also has been actively studied and applied, to the best of my knowledge, there are not many researches being conducted in RL-based dental robot control.

| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{physics} = \|v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted}\|$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	~0% accuracy		| Expected result as no supervision of any kind is provided |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{velocity+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Prediction of $v_t$ is good. Was able to learn $s_t$ reasonably well without direct supervision |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{supervised+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+(s_{predicted}-s_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Not a better result w.r.t direct supervision |


**Observations :** 
- Physics equations are certain in this case and are the best to use.
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are equivalent (actual accuracy/loss varies based on fine training, random dataset generation)

Re running the above experiments with Dataset size of 200(Data Starvation), yielded the following observations
- DL performance is comparable with 10000 dataset when trained on much mode epochs(5x)
- Hybrid(DL+Physics) without direct supervision on $s_t$ has comparable/better closeness than DL only method for limited epochs($\sim$300) training.

**Observations :** 
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are similar, Hybrid(DL+Physics) is better when $u0$ is out of dataset, DL is better for $u0$ in dataset.
- Physics equations are not certain in this case and the above methods are better to use than Physics.
