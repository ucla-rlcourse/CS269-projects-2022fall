> In many complex tasks, RL-trained policy may not solve the tasks efficiently. The training process may cost people too much time. Policy dissection is a frequency-based method, which can convert RL-trained policy into target-conditioned policy. For this method, we can interacte with the kinematic behavior and the learned neural controller.

> In this project, we want to explore the implementation of the policy dissection. We will figure out how we can use the policy deissection to solve some potential problems in the real world.
