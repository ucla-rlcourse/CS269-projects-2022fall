> For our project, we will look into what it means to explore in reinforcement learning and, more concretely, how diversity itself in the skill acquisition phase of RL can be a strategy for eventually optimizing a policy. Our primary source for this topic is a paper entitled Diversity is All You Need: Learning Skills Without a Reward Function [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10995.pdf). The authors have applied DIAYN to prototypical RL problems, namely in the balancing of an upside down pendulum on a vehicle, the mountain car problem, and 2d environment navigation. The authors also have provided reference to their code for these applications. Our concrete goal will be to implement DIAYN to reproduce the results of these papers with some alteration to the environments in order to see the robustness of this algorithm. We expect to have defensible results given the inherently generalizable nature of this algorithm, and we currently believe that the biggest roadblock in pursuing this goal will be understanding the proper intuition for avoiding a reward function and heirachically ranking skills in order to minimize time spent on solving a task.

## Main Content
Your article starts here. You can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/lilianweng/lil-log/tree/master/_posts) of [lil's blogs](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) for article structure ideas or Markdown syntax. We've provided a [sample post](https://ucla-rlcourse.github.io/CS269-projects-2022fall/2017/06/21/an-overview-of-deep-learning.html) from Lilian Weng and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/ucla-rlcourse/CS269-projects-2022fall/blob/main/_posts/2017-06-21-an-overview-of-deep-learning.md)

What is unique about this project is that the algorithm which we will be aiming to reproduce, DIAYN, approaches exploration by initializing skill acquisition with a heavy extent of entropy and with no reference to a reward function. By nature of its design, this algorithm is not problem-specific and so skills initially acquired have no dependence on maximizing reward; instead, DIAYN takes the approach of maximizing diversity of skills - that is, the number of skills capable of competing the task without heavy intersection (which is assured by a heavy degree of randomness in the skill learning phase as we currently understand it). Measuring diversity is done by collapsing skills that visit similar states into one another and not considering them discriminable. States are used to distinguish between skills since its context is a restriction on which states the agent should visit. It is a result of this formulation that remaining skills explore parts of the state space far away from another, or else skills are no longer considered different from one another.

This paper contains many useful explanations as well as the precise conception of the algorithm.

In addition, there is some generalization to 3D locomotion environments that show agents flipping, wiggling, walking, and running through their environments - we will alter these environments to attempt analyzing how changes in the environment affects the development of diverse skill acquisition.

| **DL + Physics**																																			|
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{physics} = \|v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted}\|$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	~0% accuracy		| Expected result as no supervision of any kind is provided |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{velocity+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Prediction of $v_t$ is good. Was able to learn $s_t$ reasonably well without direct supervision |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{supervised+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+(s_{predicted}-s_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Not a better result w.r.t direct supervision |


**Observations :** 
- Physics equations are certain in this case and are the best to use.
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are equivalent (actual accuracy/loss varies based on fine training, random dataset generation)

Re running the above experiments with Dataset size of 200(Data Starvation), yielded the following observations
- DL performance is comparable with 10000 dataset when trained on much mode epochs(5x)
- Hybrid(DL+Physics) without direct supervision on $s_t$ has comparable/better closeness than DL only method for limited epochs($\sim$300) training.

**Observations :** 
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are similar, Hybrid(DL+Physics) is better when $u0$ is out of dataset, DL is better for $u0$ in dataset.
- Physics equations are not certain in this case and the above methods are better to use than Physics.

## Data Starvation and Physics Uncertain
- Similar observations as in data rich
