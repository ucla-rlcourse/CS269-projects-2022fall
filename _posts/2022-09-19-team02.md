> The development of Transformers in machine learning has allowed the possibilities of high-dimensional distribution models of semantic concepts at scale. However, the applications of transformers have mostly been limited to language generalization and image generation. Therefore, this article introduces the Decision Transformer (DT), an offline reinforcement learning method. The DT uses conditional sequence modelling which allows it to leverage the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer. In the DT, an autoregressive generative model is conditioned on the return, previous states and actions. This enables the DT to obtain future actions with the desired return. Through comprehensive experiments of the DT against state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on OpenAI Gym, the DT remains extremely competitive and outperforms the other models.

## Introduction
The transformer is a sequence transduction model that utilises the attention mechanism where dependencies can be modeled regardless of their length between the input and output sequences [1]. A major advantage of the transformer is that it is able to process the whole input simultaneously, enabling parallization to improve efficacy. Within the fields of NLP and CV, a transformer is much more efficient than its counterparts where it achieves state of the art performances. Hence, the Decision Transformer (DT) aims to leverage the proficiencies of the transformer and extend its applications to the areas of reinforcement learning.

In the DT, the transformer is trained with the input of state, action and return-to-go (sum of future rewards) to create a generative trajectory model that maximises the expected return. Utilising this architecture does not require us bootstrap or discount future rewards. This is greatly beneficial since "deadly triad" [2] can be avoided where the value function suffers from instabilities as well as short-sightness of the model respectively. Furthermore, through the self-attention of a transformer, credit can be assigned directly to update the weights compared to Bellman backups where the parameterization of the model is slow and can be affected by "distractor" signals (unrelated "distractor" task containing incidental rewards that affects the model's decision making). Last but not least, the DT is modeled as an offline reinforcement learning problem, meaning that the agent does not interact with the environment and only utilizes data collected from other agents or human demonstrations [4]. With offline RL, the DT learns maximally effective policies despite only using limited data. Furthermore, the model reduce the use of policy sampling due to the autoregressive generative nature of the model.

Hence, with the aforementioned pros of the transformer, I expect the DT to train efficiently, generalize reliably and optimize accurately in a reinforcement learning setting.

## Related Works

### Offline RL
Offline RL often faces issues of distributional shifts. Therefore, works to circumvent this issue includes constraining the policy action space ([10], [11], [12]), integrating value pessimism ([10], [13]) and integrating pessimism into learned dynamic models ([14], [15]). Adding a dynamics model into model-free methods typically improve their performances. Hence, it makes sense to take it into consideration since the DT is compared to other model-free methods.

On the other hand, likelihood-based approaches ([16], [17], [18], [19]) and mutual information maximization ([20], [21], [22]) has also been used to learn task-agnostic skills. Even though the DT utilizes a simpler sequence modeling objective and rewards for conditional generation of behaviors, it still resembles likelihood-based approaches where iterative Bellman updates are not used.

### RL Supervised Learning

"Upside-down" reinforcement learning ([23], [24], [25]) bears resemblance to the DT since it seeks to model behaviors with a supervised loss conditioned on the target return. However, in the DT, it utilizes sequential learning instead of supervised learning. This allows us to use behavior modeling without requiring the reward which is known to have good scaling properties [26] and is similar to NLP [9] and CV [27].

Recently, the Trajectory Transformer (TT) [28] has also been developed which is similar to the DT but includes state prediction, return prediction and discretization that integrates model-based features. The positive results in both the TT and DT further reiterates the fact that sequence modeling has huge potential in RL and its applications should be further explored.

### Credit assignment
Several research has been written to improve credit assignment through state-association, where an architecture decomposes the reward function to depict the most salient states that would comprise the most credit ([29], [30], [31]). With the learned reward function, the algorithm updates the actor-critic reward to enable signal propagation across a long horizon. Furthermore, state-association has shown improved performance under delayed reward settings ([3], [32], [33], [34]). State-association is present in the DT in the form of the transformer architecture where a reward function or a critic is not required to be explicitly learned.

### Transformer and attention models
The application of the transformer model to machine learning subfields such as NLP ([36], [9]) and CV ([37], [38]) have shown great success. Nonetheless, its application has been relatively underexplored in reinforcement learning due to a high-variance setting.

Recent research has displayed that transformer augmentation coupled with relational reasoning improves performance in combinatorial environments [39]. Additionally, iterative self-attention leads to an improvement in episodic memory usage for RL agents [40]. Furthermore, there is also work to tackle the stabilization of transformers when there is higher variance in training [41].

These features combined emphasises the importance of exploring transformers in RL.


## Decision Transformer 

### Leveraging Offline RL
In the DT, it considers the use of offline RL to learn policies from fixed limited datasets that consists of trajectory rollouts of arbitrary policies. This is possible due to the autoregressive and generative nature of the model, where policy sampling can be reduced to produce pristine behavior from fixed, limited experience.

The DT evaluates the Offline RL section of the model using a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

#### Offline RL MDP Notations
The MDP is described using tuple $$(S, A, P, R)$$ and is broken down as follows:
- states $$s \in S$$
- actions $$a \in A$$
- transition dynamics $$P(s' \mid s, a)$$
- reward function $$r = R(s, a)$$
- state, action and reward at timestep t: $$s_t, a_t, r_t = R(s_t, a_t)$$ 
- trajectory $$\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, s_1, a_1, r_1, ..., s_T, a_T, r_T)$$
- return of trajectory at timestep $$t$$: $$R_t = \sum_{t'=t}^{T} r_{t'}$$

### Transformer architecture
A transformer is one of the recent pioneering developments in modeling sequential data efficiently. It leverages stacked self-attention layers with residual connections. A self- attention layer receives $$n$$ embeddings $$\{x_i\}^{n}_{i=1}$$ corresponding to unique input tokens, and outputs n embeddings $$\{z_i\}^{n}_{i=1}$$, preserving the input dimensions. The $$i$$-th token is mapped via linear transformations to a key $$k_i$$, query $$q_i$$, and value $$v_i$$. The $$i$$-th output of the self-attention layer is given by weighting the values $$v_j$$ by the normalized dot product between the query $$q_i$$ and other keys $$k_j$$. The output $$z_i$$ is modeled as follows.

<!-- equation issue here with the \dot -->
$$z_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n}softmax(\{<q_i, k_{j'}>\}_{j'=1}^{n})_j \cdot v_j$$

### Decision Transformer Architecture
In order to generate actions based on future desired returns instead of past rewards, the DT replace the reward function with "returns-to-go" $$(\hat R_t = \sum_{t = t'}^{T} r_{t'})$$. Thus, our trajectory $$\tau$$ is as follows: 

$$(\hat R_1, s_1, a_1, \hat R_2, s_2, a_2, ..., \hat R_T, s_T, a_T)$$

The last K timesteps are fed into the DT i.e. 3K tokens (1K for each modality: return-to-go, state and action). In each of the modalities, the DT learns a linear layer to project raw inputs to the embedding dimension, followed by layer normalization. Environments using visual inputs learn a convolutional encoder instead of a linear layer. Furthermore, an embedding for each timestep is learned and added to each token. Lastly, it utilizes GPT [9] to process the tokens.

The DT sample minibatches of sequence length K from the dataset of offline trajectories. Cross-entropy loss and mean-squared error is used to evaluate the prediction head corresponding to the input token $$s_t$$ for discrete and continuous actions respectively. Finally, the losses are averaged for each timestep.

## Experiments and Discussions
I evaluate the performance of the Decision Transformer against other state-of-the-art model-free methods using the OpenAI Gym. The hyperparameters used suggested by the authors are as follows. 

- Batch Size = 64
- Dropout = 0.1
- Learning Rate = 0.0001
- Weight Decay = 0.0001
- Gradient Norm Clipping = 0.25
- Return-to-go conditioning (HalfCheetah) = 6000
- Return-to-go conditioning (Hopper) = 3600
- Return-to-go conditioning (Walker) = 5000

The dataset used in the experiments is the "Medium-Replay" dataset. It is the replay buffer of an agent trained to the performance of a medium policy.

The model-free methods that will be compared against include CQL [5], BEAR [6], BRAC [7], and AWR [8]. The values are reported from the Decision Transformer paper. The results of the expected returns are as follows. They are normalized so that a return of 100 is equivalent to an expert policy.

### Table 1. Performance of the Decision Transformer against other SOTA model-free methods using the OpenAI Gym

| Dataset       | Environment | DT (my run) | DT (authors' run)|   CQL  | BEAR  | BRAC-v|  AWR  |
| :---          |    :----:   |    :----:   |       :----:     |  :----:| :----:| :----:|  ---: | 
| Medium-Replay | HalfCheetah | 45.0        | 36.6             | 46.2   | 38.6  | 47.7  | 40.3  |
| Medium-Replay | Hopper      | 27.3        | 82.7             | 48.6   | 33.7  | 0.6   | 28.4  | 
| Medium-Replay | Walker      | 28.7        | 66.6             | 26.7   | 19.2  | 0.9   | 15.5  | 


As shown in the table above, due to limited computational power and larger datasets of Hopper and Walker, I am unable achieve similar performance results. On the other hand, my result achieved from HalfCheetah (45.0) is competitive against the SOTA BRAC-v (47.7) and better than the authors' result of 36.6.

*Fig 3. Walker's Performance vs. Target Return.

In the figures above, we observe the average sampled return accumulated by the agent over the course of the evaluation episode (Performance) for varying values of target return.

As observed, for both the Walker and Hopper, the performance is still increasing and I believe that with more computing power, I will be able to reproduce the author’s results.

Furthermore, as seen in the Cheetah plot, the increase in performance has plateaued and is already state-of-the-art.

### Video Demos of Cheetah, Hopper and Walker

#### Hopper

#### Walker

Since I achieve SOTA performance when training in the Cheetah environment, we observe that the Cheetah demo is fully functional and can run at ease.

On the other hand, since the Hopper and Walker is unable to achieve SOTA, we observe that the agent fails to function after a period of time.


## Conclusion

I explore the Decision Transformer where ideas from both reinforcement learning and sequence modeling are combined. Additionally, there has been several areas of related works that contributes to the DT development including offline RL, RL supervised learning, credit assignment, transformers and attention models. By leveraging offline RL in the DT, one key advantage is that it is able to learn from fixed limited datasets which is very useful due to the high costs and difficulties in obtaining large reliable datasets. In my experiments on the OpenAI Gym, I have proven that the DT remains extremely competitive if not outperforming several other model-free methods. With further training and more computational power, I believe that the DT will definitely outperform the other model-free methods as shown from the authors' results. This showcases the immense potential and capabilities of Transformer applications within the fields of RL and it could definitely be developed further to improve its generalization abilities.
