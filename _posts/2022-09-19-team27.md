> In this project, we are aiming to apply reinforcement learning techniques on real finance market data. To start, we would adapt the OpenBB Terminal environment and begin with stock market data. By using OpenBB, we are interested in analyze the real-world finance data and discover how reinforcement learning can be used to predict the market. During the initial stage, we would reproduce the results from the contributors. Afterwards, we would love to explore the effectiveness the system has on various data we gather.

## Potential Approaches
In this project, we are aiming to apply reinforcement learning techniques on real finance market data. To start, we would adapt the [OpenBB](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) Terminal environment and begin with stock market data.

By using OpenBB, we are interested in analyze the real-world finance data and discover how reinforcement learning can be used to predict the market. During the initial stage, we would reproduce the results from the contributors. Afterwards, we would love to explore the effectiveness the system has on various data we gather.

Overall, we would love to evaluate and forecast the stock market in the OpenBB environment and understand the potential future with reinforcement learning applications.

OpenBB is a leading open source investment research software platform for accessing and analyzing financial market data, and its terminal has the analytical capabilities in various categories such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, foreign exchanges...etc. With all the interesting features OpenBB offers, the "stock forecasting" feature is the one we are attempting to evaluate and possibly reproduce the results from. Similar to what we have learned in the CS 269 course, the feature utilizes the reinforcement learning techniques to create predictions and demonstrates the visualization fo long-term stock trends. The forecasting feature is a machine learning toolkit that predicts the future stock price based on the data of selected stocks and time frames, and the prediction is based on a reinforcement learning technique -- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN model in the feature consists of two modes, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and model is evaluated by its accuracy and Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) as metrics.

## What Is Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
RNN is an deep learning / neural network technique in reinforcement learning where the model's current input is the output from the previous steps. Since the network requires memorization of the previous outputs, LSTM and GRU is utilized as the storage to perfrom such tasks. By having such memorization implementation, the RNN is specifically useful for time series prediction such as the stock forecasting application we are analyzing for this project.

## What Is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
For the reinforcement learning purpose, we are focusing on the model with LSTM backbone in the feature. LSTM network is a deep learning system that has feedback connections, which can establish a RNN architecture capable of processing a sequence of data; in other words, the system provides short-term memory which lasts for numerous timesteps. In our case, we take advantage of LSTM to process time series of stock data.
