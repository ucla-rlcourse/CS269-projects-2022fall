> In this project, we are aiming to apply reinforcement learning techniques on real finance market data. To start, we would adapt the OpenBB Terminal environment and begin with stock market data. By using OpenBB, we are interested in analyze the real-world finance data and discover how reinforcement learning can be used to predict the market. During the initial stage, we would reproduce the results from the contributors. Afterwards, we would love to explore the effectiveness the system has on various data we gather.

## Potential Approaches

In this project, we are aiming to apply reinforcement learning techniques on real finance market data. To start, we would adapt the OpenBB Terminal environment and begin with stock market data. (https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal)

By using OpenBB, we are interested in analyze the real-world finance data and discover how reinforcement learning can be used to predict the market. During the initial stage, we would reproduce the results from the contributors. Afterwards, we would love to explore the effectiveness the system has on various data we gather.

Overall, we would love to evaluate and forecast the stock market in the OpenBB environment and understand the potential future with reinforcement learning applications.
