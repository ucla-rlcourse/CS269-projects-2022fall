> The project mainly focuses on the problem of traffic simulation as a kind of Self-Driven Particles (SDP) problem using reinforcement learning. We plan to apply a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm (MARL) called Coordinated Policy Optimization (CoPo) for this problem. For the method evaluation, we plan to deploy this model to a driving simulator called MetaDrive, including five typical traffic environments, and analyze the behaviors of the individuals.
