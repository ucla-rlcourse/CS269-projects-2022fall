> As the most popular sport on the planet, millions of fans enjoy watching Sergio Ag√ºero, Raheem Sterling, and Kevin de Bruyne on the field. Football video games are less lively, but still immensely popular, and we wonder if AI agents would be able to play those properly. Researchers want to explore AI agents' ability to play in complex settings like football. The sport requires a balance of short-term control, learned concepts such as passing, and high-level strategy, which can be difficult to teach agents. We apply RL to train the agents to see if we can achieve good performances.

## Introduction
In this work, we will utilize the football simulation platform provided by Google Research. The goal is to train an intelligent agent to play football that can achieve the highest score. More detailed information can be found in [Google Research Football with Manchester City F.C.
](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-football)

The whole project can be divided into multiple states. First of all, we will develop simple rule-based agents to collect training episodes. After that, we will use these collected episodes to train our deep learinng model based agents. In the end we will show the superior performances of our model based agents against the baseline agents. After that we will creatively combine the two and show how to influence the agents to favor certain types of tactics which are critical for football coaches.

We've provided a [sample post](https://ucla-rlcourse.github.io/CS269-projects-2022fall/2017/06/21/an-overview-of-deep-learning.html) from Lilian Weng and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/ucla-rlcourse/CS269-projects-2022fall/blob/main/_posts/2017-06-21-an-overview-of-deep-learning.md)

## Basic Syntax
### Image
Please create a folder with the name of your team id under `/assets/images/`, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.

You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/team00/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}

Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work.


### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |



### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$. -->
