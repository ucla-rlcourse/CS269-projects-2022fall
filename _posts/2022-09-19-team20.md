## Introduction
We will investigate the problem of room rearrangement. In this task, an agent first explores a room and records the configurations of objects, using visual information available to it including RGB images and depth maps. After changing the poses/states of some objects in the room without the agent present, the agent must then restore the room to its original state.

## Proposed Work
We will train several different types of models to perform the task, and compare their relative performance. We expect a pure RL model to struggle with this task, as Weihs et al. describe. We will apply pure RL, deep RL, and genetic algorithms to room rearrangement, with more techniques explored if time allows.

## Proposed Environment
Our initial explorations will be based on the [AI2-THOR](https://ai2thor.allenai.org/) open source interactive environment, which allows for AI agents to interact with a realistic 3D environment. Agents have 82 actions available to them, including moving, rotating, and/or looking in any direction, and manipulating objects in the environment. We will use the RoomR dataset compiled by [Weihs et al., 2021].
