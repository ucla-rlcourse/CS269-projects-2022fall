## Introduction
Self-Driven Particles(SDP) are common in human society such as various categories of multi-agent systems(MAS). We will explore on a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method, Coordinated Policy Optimization(CoPO)[1] which has been tested that having a better performance than previous MARL methods: Curriculum Learning(CL)[2], Mean Field Policy Optimization(MFPO)[3], and Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO)[4]. The original CoPO has three rewards, Individual Reward and Neighborhood Reward as Local Coordination, and Global Reward as Global Coordination. Although the data of the results looks in a good performance, the movement of the agents are not in a human way which is conflicting with the concept of observing how human interacts. We decide to design new reward policy in order to have the same performance with better movement.


## Proposed Work
The project will consists of two parts. In the first part, we will reproduce the results from Independent Policy Optimization[5], IPO, (implemented with PPO), MFPO, CL, CoPO. Fine-tuning of the models will be attempted to explore possibly better results. During the second part, we will degisn, implement, train, and test our own models. We plan to design our model based on what is provided by CoPO. Noticing in the scenarios shown in the CoPO paper that the agents frenquently makes slight turns or sometimes makes half-lane changes, we aim to eliminate these seemingly meaningless actions through additional rewards. We propose to add rewards related to the frequency of turns made by the agent. The less the agent turns, the more it gains from the added reward. One drawback of this approach would be since the agents have low incentive to maneuver themselves frequently, it could lead the environment to congestion. In order to address this issue, we add an additional reward related to the timely arrival of the agent. During training, the agent will determine the best balance between low travel time and frequent lane changes. Moreover, we could use the philosophy proposed by CoPO, neighborhood reward, to coordinate the newly added rewards.

## Expected Result
We will use the performance metric, triangle graph, used in the CoPO paper to discuss the expected result.
- We expect the safety of our model to be at least as good as CoPO in all scenarios, simply because less frequent lane changes would make the agents less likely to crash.
- Regarding efficiency, we also expect increase due to the fact that our models makes less meaningless maneuvers that could effect the agents' own and potentially other agents' efficiency.
- However, they might be a performance drop in success rate because the lack of incentive to make lane changes by the agents could lead to traffic gridlock.


## Potential Environment
MetaDrive in Python
