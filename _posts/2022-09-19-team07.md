## Summary
We want to implement Reinforcement learning on the topic of financial Portfolio optimization, which is one of the most important topic in assets mangement industry. We want to show the potential ability of Reinforcement learning on this area and, ideally, we will able to show that our model could create a portfolio which has much better performance than main index in financial market.


## Goal of the project
We will start by reproducing some related papers, like Deep Reinforcement Learning with LFSS[1]. Then, we will identify and collect data that will have direct or indirect impacts on the stock market, with a focus on changes in monetary policy[2]. Furthermore, if the experiment succeeds, we will attempt to use forecasting techniques to predict the movement of the portfolio as a whole or a subset of it. We expect to create a forecast model that matches the performance of the S&P 500, a commonly used stock market index.
