## Introduction
In this project, we will investigate Transformer in Reinforcement Learning. There is a popular model called the decision transformer which abstracts Reinforcement Learning as a conditional-sequence modeling problem. We will train an Offline Decision Transformer model from scratch to make a half-cheetah run. We will be training with the half-cheetah "expert" dataset from the huggingface hub. We also want to use a general reinforcement learning algorithm to compare with the Transformer (sequence modeling algorithm) to see the which will perform better, and why perform better.
