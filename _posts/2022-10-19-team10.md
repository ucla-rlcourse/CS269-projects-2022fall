> In many complex tasks, RL-trained policy may not solve the tasks efficiently. The training process may cost people too much time. Policy dissection is a frequency-based method, which can convert RL-trained policy into target-conditioned policy. For this method, we can interacte with the kinematic behavior and the learned neural controller.
>
> In this project, we want to explore the implementation of the policy dissection. We will figure out how we can use the policy deissection to solve some potential problems in the real world.

## Main Content
This article will refer to the [source code](https://github.com/metadriverse/policydissect) .

First of all, we want to explore the relationship between kinematic behavior and the neural activities. In this experiment, we want to figure out the patterns behind some certain behaviors. 

Second, we want to train bipedal robots,Cassie, in [IsaacGym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs), based on the patterns that we figured out. The robots will be trained to have some complex behaviors such as crouch, turn left, turn right, back flip, tiptoe, jump etc. 

Third, we want to explore whether the bipedal robots can handle many complex situations within the human instruction.

Fourth, we want to explore whether we can improve the algoirthm.

For improving the algorithm, we may potentially compare the policy based, value-based and model based methods, and choose the best performance methods.

Finally, we will try to figure out whther we can implement the policy dissection to the other complex tasks in the real world.

We are still working on finding the real world problems. 





## Basic Syntax
### Image
Please create a folder with the name of your team id under `/assets/images/`, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.

You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/team10/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}
*Fig 1. YOLO: An object detection method in computer vision* [1].

Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work.


### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |



### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.

| **DL + Data**																																						|

| Predicting only velocity  	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->5->5->1 <br> activation: ReLU	|  ~100% accurate	| Generalises well over various initial velocities |
| Predicting only displacement 	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable		| Better prediction for $u_0 \in dataset$, average prediction outside | 
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$	| Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->2 <br>	activation: tanh	|	Reasonable		| Better prediction for $u_0 \in dataset$, poor prediction outside |

| **DL + Physics**																																			|
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{physics} = \|v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted}\|$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	~0% accuracy		| Expected result as no supervision of any kind is provided |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{velocity+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Prediction of $v_t$ is good. Was able to learn $s_t$ reasonably well without direct supervision |
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$, using Loss $L_{supervised+phy} = (v_{predicted}-v_{actual})^2+(s_{predicted}-s_{actual})^2+\gamma*(v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted})^2$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	Reasonable	| Not a better result w.r.t direct supervision |


**Observations :** 
- Physics equations are certain in this case and are the best to use.
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are equivalent (actual accuracy/loss varies based on fine training, random dataset generation)

Re running the above experiments with Dataset size of 200(Data Starvation), yielded the following observations
- DL performance is comparable with 10000 dataset when trained on much mode epochs(5x)
- Hybrid(DL+Physics) without direct supervision on $s_t$ has comparable/better closeness than DL only method for limited epochs($\sim$300) training.

| **DL + Physics**																																			|
| Predicting both $v_t, s_t$<br> using Loss $L_{physics} = \|v_{predicted}^2-u_{initial}^2-2*g*s_{predicted}\|$ | Dataset size : 10000<br> Network : 2->16->16->1 <br>	activation: ReLU |	~0% accuracy		| Expected result as no supervision of any kind is provided |

**Observations :** 
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are similar, Hybrid(DL+Physics) is better when $u0$ is out of dataset, DL is better for $u0$ in dataset.
- Physics equations are not certain in this case and the above methods are better to use than Physics.

## Data Starvation and Physics Uncertain
- Similar observations as in data rich
