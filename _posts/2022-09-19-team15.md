## Introduction
In this project, we aim to study the effects of multi-agent and cooperation between multi-agent in avoiding real-world traffic collisions. While autonomous driving has become increasingly popular in the past decade, it also raised safety concerns about whether human and AI driven cars can safely share the road together without increasing number of collisions. In this project, we ask the following question: is it safer to fit agents into a human-dominant traffic environment, or to give agents full control of all traffic on road without human drivers involved? The former can be considered a *hybrid environment* where the agents learn policies that align with existing traffic rules. The latter, however, does not contain any human driver and hence places no constraints on the behaviors of the agents. One advantage of the multi-agent model is that it permits real-time communications among agents, which could potentially decreases the risk of accidents.

In particular, we run a comparative study on the following three models:
* **Single-agent Model (Baseline).**  In a traffic environment, we randomly pick one driver from all drivers and make it a controllable agent. The agent needs to learn a policy such that it does not cause any collision with other human drivers.
* **Hybrid Model.** We randomly pick half of the drivers to be controllable agents. In the case without cooperations, each agent delivers a policy based on its own state and observation. In the case with cooperations, the agents deliver policies that may depend on other agents' observations and actions.  
* **Agents-only Model.** All the drivers in the environment are controllable agents. Similar to the cases for Hybrid Model, the agents may or may not share information depending on whether cooperations are allowed.

Different reward functions will be tuned to optimize the performance [Mataric]. We evaluate following metrics:
* **Collision Avoidance/Task Completion:** Whether or not the agents can avoid collisions while reaching the expected final location within the timeframe for each episode. 
* **Training Resource:** Time/memory required for the RL training.
<br /><br />

## Environment and Data

The environment we will be using is Nocturne [Vinitsky et al.]. Nocturne is a 2D driving simulator built from traffic scenarios in the Waymo Open Dataset. The uniqueness of this simulator is that it can compute an agent's visible objects as shown in Figure 1, and can generate more than 2000 states for each agents for a single second timeframe.

![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/team15/git_intersection_combined.gif' | relative_url }}){: style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"} Figure 1: A visual showing the traffic for a specific scene on the road (Left). And the obstructed view of the single viewing blue agent (Right).



Currently, Nocturne generates environments based on a set of initial and final road object positions and (optionally) a set of trajectories for the road objects obtained from the Waymo Motion Dataset [Ettinger et al.] However, Nocturne currently does not support traffic lights, pedestrians or cyclists within the environment due to certain contraints and challenges within the Waymo Motion Dataset. So we will not be considering these within our exploration as well.

For states representations, Nocturne provides two different ways: an image and a vectorized representation of the image. For ease of use, we will be mainly using the vectorized representation for training. 

<!-- Here we define the vehicle that is being trained and require observation from the environment as the traning vehicle agent (TVA). -->

Based on the environment and states, we could be able to get a list of following **observable infomation** for each of the vehicle in the environment:
    
* The speed of the vehicle
* The distance and angle to goal position
* The width and length of the vehicle
* The relative speed and heading compared to the expert driver (human data)
* The angle between the velocity vectors of a specific vehicle and all other vehicles in the environment
* The angle and distance to a specific vehicle from all other vehicles in the environment
* Other road objects' heading relative to the a specific vehicle

And each vehicle in the environment can take the following **actions**:
* acceleration: 6 actions from [-3, 2] $m/s^2$
* steering: 21 actions between [-0.7,0.7] radians
* head tilt: 5 actions between [-1.6,1.6] radians

Partial observability is achieved by setting a 120-degree view-cone for the training agent. Within the 120-degree view-cone, all vehicles that intersect with a single ray in the cone and is not blocked by other vehicles closer to the training agent is considered visible. During training, agents will only be able to obtain information from observable vehicles, and is able to use head tilt action to adjust the view-cone to obtain more information.
<br />

<!-- And each **episode** is defined as follows:
* 9 second per episode
* each step is 0.1 second -->

<!-- We will be using this generated environment for our Reinforcement Learning model training. -->

## RL Models
For Single-agent model, we consider the Deep Q-learning algorithm [Watkins, Dayan], [Mnih et al.], which follows Q-learning but usese a neural network to map each state and observation into pairs of action and Q-value. The policy is improved when updating the weights of the neural network.

For multi-agent model without cooperations, we simply create multiple agents and apply the Deep Q-learning algorithm for each agent independently.

For multi-agent model with coorperations, we consider the MADDPG algorithm [Lowe et al.], where a centralized Q function is used to integrate information from other agents. 

We also consider a partial-observation environment. That is, at different time frames, an agent may only observe different portion of the environment. We apply the technique of Attention [Vaswani et al.] [Iqbal and Sha] to obtain embeddings with fixed lengths.

## Packages & Libraries
We may use the following packages (subject to change):
* Python3
* Nocturne and Waymo dataset packages
* OpenAI - MADDPG
* PyTorch
* Other Python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, etc.

**Observations :** 
- Physics equations are certain in this case and are the best to use.
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are equivalent (actual accuracy/loss varies based on fine training, random dataset generation)

Re running the above experiments with Dataset size of 200(Data Starvation), yielded the following observations
- DL performance is comparable with 10000 dataset when trained on much mode epochs(5x)
- Hybrid(DL+Physics) without direct supervision on $s_t$ has comparable/better closeness than DL only method for limited epochs($\sim$300) training.

**Observations :** 
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are similar, Hybrid(DL+Physics) is better when $u0$ is out of dataset, DL is better for $u0$ in dataset.
- Physics equations are not certain in this case and the above methods are better to use than Physics.

## Data Starvation and Physics Uncertain
- Similar observations as in data rich
