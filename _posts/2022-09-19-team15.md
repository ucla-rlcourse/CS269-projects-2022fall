## Introduction
In this project, we study the effects of cooperation between multi-agent in avoiding real-world traffic collisions. While autonomous driving has become increasingly popular in the past decade, it also raised safety concerns such as whether human and AI-driven cars can safely share the road. We consider the following two questions: (1) Is cooperation among agents helpful in terms of reducing the collision rate? (2) Is it safe to keep human drivers involved in a multi-agent system? Intuitively, cooperations permit agents to plan routes and detect collisions early, which could potentially decrease the risk of accidents. On the other hand, the degree of cooperation may also depend on the number of agents vs. human drivers. While the agents can benefit from human behaviors through imitation, they may also be prohibited from exploring more efficient driving strategies. 

In particular, we run a comparative study on the following three models:
* **Single-agent Model (Baseline).**  In a traffic environment, we randomly pick one driver from all drivers and make it a controllable agent. The agent needs to learn a policy such that it does not cause any collision with other human drivers.
* **Hybrid Model.** We randomly pick half of the drivers to be controllable agents. In the case without cooperations, each agent delivers a policy based on its own state and observation. In the case with cooperations, the agents deliver policies that may depend on other agents' observations and actions.  
* **Agents-only Model.** All the drivers in the environment are controllable agents. Similar to the cases for Hybrid Model, the agents may or may not share information depending on whether cooperations are allowed.

Different reward functions will be tuned to optimize the performance [Mataric]. We evaluate following metrics:
* **Collision Avoidance/Task Completion:** Whether or not the agents can avoid collisions while reaching the expected final location within the timeframe for each episode. 
* **Training Resource:** Time/memory required for the RL training.
<br /><br />

## Environment and Data

The environment we will be using is Nocturne [Vinitsky et al.]. Nocturne is a 2D driving simulator built from traffic scenarios in the Waymo Open Dataset. The uniqueness of this simulator is that it can compute an agent's visible objects as shown in Figure 1, and can generate more than 2000 states for each agents for a single second timeframe.

Currently, Nocturne generates environments based on a set of initial and final road object positions and (optionally) a set of trajectories for the road objects obtained from the Waymo Motion Dataset [Ettinger et al.] However, Nocturne currently does not support traffic lights, pedestrians or cyclists within the environment due to certain contraints and challenges within the Waymo Motion Dataset. So we will not be considering these within our exploration as well.

For states representations, Nocturne provides two different ways: an image and a vectorized representation of the image. For ease of use, we will be mainly using the vectorized representation for training. 

<!-- Here we define the vehicle that is being trained and require observation from the environment as the traning vehicle agent (TVA). -->

Based on the environment and states, we could be able to get a list of following **observable infomation** for each of the vehicle in the environment:
    
* The speed of the vehicle
* The distance and angle to goal position
* The width and length of the vehicle
* The relative speed and heading compared to the expert driver (human data)
* The angle between the velocity vectors of a specific vehicle and all other vehicles in the environment
* The angle and distance to a specific vehicle from all other vehicles in the environment
* Other road objects' heading relative to the a specific vehicle

And each vehicle in the environment can take the following **actions**:
* acceleration: 6 actions from [-3, 2] $m/s^2$
* steering: 21 actions between [-0.7,0.7] radians
* head tilt: 5 actions between [-1.6,1.6] radians

Partial observability is achieved by setting a 120-degree view-cone for the training agent. Within the 120-degree view-cone, all vehicles that intersect with a single ray in the cone and is not blocked by other vehicles closer to the training agent is considered visible. During training, agents will only be able to obtain information from observable vehicles, and is able to use head tilt action to adjust the view-cone to obtain more information.
<br />

<!-- And each **episode** is defined as follows:
* 9 second per episode
* each step is 0.1 second -->

<!-- We will be using this generated environment for our Reinforcement Learning model training. -->

## RL Models
For Single-agent model, we consider the Deep Q-learning algorithm [Watkins, Dayan], [Mnih et al.], which follows Q-learning but usese a neural network to map each state and observation into pairs of action and Q-value. The policy is improved when updating the weights of the neural network.

For multi-agent model without cooperations, we simply create multiple agents and apply the Deep Q-learning algorithm for each agent independently.

For multi-agent model with coorperations, we consider the MADDPG algorithm [Lowe et al.], where a centralized Q function is used to integrate information from other agents. 

We also consider a partial-observation environment. That is, at different time frames, an agent may only observe different portion of the environment. We apply the technique of Attention [Vaswani et al.] [Iqbal and Sha] to obtain embeddings with fixed lengths.
<br /><br />

## Packages & Libraries
We may use the following packages (subject to change):
* Python3
* Nocturne and Waymo dataset packages
* OpenAI - MADDPG
* PyTorch
* Other Python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, etc.
<br /><br />

## Midterm Update:

Before end of week 7, we have made three main contributions to this project.

First, we downloaded the environment source code from nocture https://github.com/facebookresearch/nocturne and managed to get most of the code running on local desktop, including creating the environment, generating scenarios, making actions and rendering the final 2D live images for training purpose. However, we did not managed to run the original RL models provided in the Nocturne source code as it require GPU and heavy usage of heap memory, both of our systems cannot provide this resource. To cope with this issue, we are going to conduct experiements in the two different ways for the coming week.
  * Utilizing google Colab to run the source code. (We have encounter multiple issues of running Nocturne on Colab, before this midterm report. We want to try some more method to see if this could be applicable)
  * Implement a smaller and system friendly model such as the policy gradient models or the deep-q model. 

Then, we studied the nocturne envrionment and summarize the important features as follows:

* The Nocturne environment is similar to the ```gym``` library, for example:
  ```
  obs, rew, done, info = env.step({
            veh.id: Action(acceleration=2.0, steering=0.0, head_angle=0.5)
            for veh in moving_vehs
  })
  ```
  where obs, rew, done, info stand for observation, reward, done, information, repsectivley.

* **Obesrvation**: A vector of dimension ```13470``` , representing the driver's view
* **Reward**: A single Float value representing the reward
* **Done**: A Boolean representing if agent reach an end state 
* **Info**: Contains other useful informations:
  
  * ```goal_chieved```: A Boolean representing whether of not goal is achieved
  * ```collided```: A Boolean representing if collision occurs
  * ```veh_veh_collision```: A Boolean representing if agent collides with another vehicle
  * ```veh_edge_collision```: A Boolean representing if agent collides with road edge 

<br />

* **Number of Agents**: This could be adjusted in the config.yaml file, to change the maximum number of controllable agents within the envrionement

<br />

* **Actions** (all the number of actions could be customized):
  * Acceleration: 6 values in range ```[-3,2]```
  * Steering: 21 values in range ```[-0.7, 0.7]``` (maximum 40 degrees)
  * Head angles: 5 values in range ```[-1.6, 1.6]```
  * Since currently the action space is fairly large, we will consider reducing the available actions in future development for faster computation


<br />

* **Choice of Dataset**:
  To reduce the amount of computation and time of training the model, we restrict the data to 1000 training files with 100 validation files, which is about 1G of data, compared to the full dataset (15G).

<br />

* Sample scenarios generated from the Nocturne environment:

  <p style="text-align: center;"> Figure 6: A sample of the entire traffic environment snippet </p>
 
  

Finally, we implemented a Deep-Q model to train a single agent in the Nocturne environment given the 1G of data. Specifically, we used fully-connected neural networks for both the policy & target network. We also employed the concept of Replay buffer. The training is divided into two stages. In the first stage, all objects follow the actions of experts, during which the Deep-Q model gets pretrained using the real data from the replay buffer. In the second stage, we use the Deep-Q model to predict the actions of the training agent while keeping all other objects behaving like experts. The following screenshot depicts a sample training iteration over one episode.

## Next Steps
* We plan to finish the single-agent training on more episodes and check if it can achieve a high reward.
* We will then explore the multi-agent system. We will first implement a system without cooperations, which can be achieved by simply creating a Deep-Q model
for each trainable agent.
* We will then implement a cooperative system that was developed by [Ryan Lowe et al.].
* Our analysis will contain a comparison of (1) non-cooperative vs. cooperative system (2) number of trainable agents in the RL system.

**Observations :** 
- Physics equations are certain in this case and are the best to use.
- Both DL, Hybrid(DL+Physics) methods performance are equivalent (actual accuracy/loss varies based on fine training, random dataset generation)

Re running the above experiments with Dataset size of 200(Data Starvation), yielded the following observations
- DL performance is comparable with 10000 dataset when trained on much mode epochs(5x)
- Hybrid(DL+Physics) without direct supervision on $s_t$ has comparable/better closeness than DL only method for limited epochs($\sim$300) training.

## Data Starvation and Physics Uncertain
- Similar observations as in data rich
