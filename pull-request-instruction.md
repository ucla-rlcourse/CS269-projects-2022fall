## Instruction of using git to manage your projects.

### Step 1

Fork the project repository to your github account:

### Step 2

Clone and enter the **forked** project repository under your github.

### Step 3

Start working on your project and use the folloing code to commit changes of your work. You can commit constantly or you can make one final commit before you want to make submission. But do not forget to commit your work.
```
git add .
git commit -m "some changes"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4

Once you are ready to submit, click "New pull request" under your **forked** repository (read block in image).

![pull1](/assets/images/UCLAdeepvision/pull_request.png)

This will lead you to this page:

![pull2](/assets/images/UCLAdeepvision/make_request.png)

When you see "Able to merge", click "Create pull request" on the right. If your status is not "Able to merge", please double check you only modified .md file and your image folder.

Enter the pull request title with format "teamid-weekN" where N is the week number of this quarter (team01-week4 for example), and add a description if you want.

**Please check and make sure you do not have any conflict after the pull request. Please fix the conflict on your end and fail to fix it after deadline may lead to late penalty.**

Create pull request and we will respond your request first week after each deadline.
