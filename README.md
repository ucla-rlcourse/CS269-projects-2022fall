## Working on the project

1. Create a folder with your team id under ```./assets/images/your-teamid```, you will use this folder to store all the images in your project.

2. Copy the template at ```./_posts/2022-04-10-team00-instruction-to-post.md``` and rename it with format "year-month-date-yourteamid-projectshortname.md" under ```./_posts/```, for example, **2022-04-10-team01-object-detection.md**

3. Check out the [sample posts](https://ucladeepvision.github.io/CS269-projects-2022spring) we provide and the [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLAdeepvision/CS269-projects-2022spring/main/_posts/2022-04-10-team00-instruction-to-post.md) as well as [basic Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

4. Start your work in your .md file. You may only edit the .md file you just copied and renamed, and add images to ```./assets/images/your-teamid```. Please do **NOT** change any other files in this repo.

Once you save the .md file, jekyll will synchronize the site and you can check the changes on browser.

## Submission

Once you've done, follow steps 3 and 4 in [pull-request-instruction](pull-request-instruction.md) to make a pull request BEFORE the deadline. Please make sure not to modify any file except your .md file and your images folder. We will merge the request after all submissions are received, and you should able to check your work in the project page on next week of each deadline.
