```html
<script src="/assets/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script>
<script>addBackToTop()</script>
```

<a id="#import"></a>You can also install the package via npm and import it into your bundle:
```bash
npm install --save vanilla-back-to-top
```
```js
import { addBackToTop } from 'vanilla-back-to-top'
addBackToTop()
```
